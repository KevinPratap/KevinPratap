# 👋 Hi, I’m Kevin Pratap Sidhu

I’m an MBA Technology (AI) student at SVKM’s NMIMS with a passion for artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data-driven solutions.

I build real-world machine learning projects using Python, Scikit-Learn, and SQL that solve practical problems and demonstrate core competencies in predictive modeling and data analytics.

🔭 I’m currently seeking **AI/ML internship opportunities** to apply and expand my skills.  
🌱 I’m continuously learning and exploring advanced ML techniques, model optimization, and deployment best practices.
